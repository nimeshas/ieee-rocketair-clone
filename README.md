# ieee-rocketair-clone
frontend task for ieee-replicating any one page with navbar and footer

Link for the website deployed on vercel: https://ieee-rocketair-clone.vercel.app/

Features of this website:
1)Navbar with the logo, a Get in Touch button, and a burger menu.
2)The partners page which has a carousel of the partner companies with their logo and a small description.
3)The footer, is divided into two halves:
Left half:
An email input, with a call to action subscribe button.
Right half:
Menu bar, social media, and privacy policy links.

Implementation:
This project is built using basic HTML and CSS for structure and styling. Some parts of the layout and responsiveness are enhanced using Bootstrap 5. 
Additionally, Splide.js is used on one page to implement a responsive carousel component and also the custom cursor.

1)Firstly, i created the navbar and the footer using basic HTML and CSS.
2)Then i tried to add some of the animations for the buttons using CSS.
3)I also used page inspect to make the site look for accurate.
4)I then tried to recreate the partners page, and the carousel using Splide.js
5)I made all these components of the website seperately and added them to one file at the end.


Since this is one of my first web development projects, I was not able to recreate some of the features very accurately.
If given some more time, I would make the page more responsive across different screens, 
and i would also prefer using animation libraries rather then jsut CSS for smoother animations.
